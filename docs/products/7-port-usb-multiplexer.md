## Introduction

Providing underwater robots the ability to perceive the ocean is an important mission behind our cameras. With the exploreHD Multiplexer, you can now connect 7 cameras in one port with low latency and extreme reliability. Whether you are looking to increase the efficiency in your mission, improve the capabilities in your autonomous systems, or add further tooling options in your vehicle, the exploreHD Multiplexer board will enable you to complete these goals by providing you with the vision needed. 

Designed to be as easy to use as possible: plug and play with our cameras, no soldering required, no drivers needed, easy to mount on the most popular underwater systems (BlueROV, Raspberry Pi, etc).

## Installation

```{note} If the camera is going into an ROV electronic enclosure, you will need to waterproof the wires properly using a cable penetrator. You can either use potted penetrators or WetLink from Blue Robotics.

Recommended Cable Penetrators 

[**Potted Penetrators (M10 thread, for 3-4 mm cable)**](https://bluerobotics.com/store/cables-connectors/penetrators/penetrator-vp/)

[**WetLink Penetrator (WLP-M10-4.5MM-HC (for 4.0 mm cable)**](https://bluerobotics.com/store/cables-connectors/penetrators/wlp-vp/)
```

```{dropdown} Cable Waterproofing

**Step 1**

![exploreHD](../img/explorehd/cable_waterproofing/exploreHD_ROV_Camera_Cable_Step_1_200x.jpg)

Ensure that the camera is mounted securely on the ROV as you like it with the previous steps

**Step 2**

![exploreHD](../img/explorehd/cable_waterproofing/exploreHD_ROV_Camera_Cable_Step_2_200x.jpg)

Cut off the USB cable to the desired length. Ensure to leave extra length for when the cable is in the enclosure.

**Step 3**

![exploreHD](../img/explorehd/cable_waterproofing/exploreHD_ROV_Camera_Cable_Step_3_200x.jpg)

Strip the cable to the length that will be in the electronic enclosure.

**Step 4**

Twist the section of wires that are stripped from the black rubber insulation

**Step 5**

Depending on the cable penetrator you are using, follow the instructions to waterproof the wires

````{dropdown} Camera Installation

**Step 1**

<b>Before attaching the wires to the provided connector housing, please ensure the following tasks have been completed</b>

* Cable is properly waterproofed, following the steps in the previous page. 

* Cable penetrator has the o'ring in the o'ring groove. 

* Cable penetrator is on the outer portion of the electronic housing end cap.

* The wires have been passed through the nut for the cable penetrator. 

* The nut is on the inner portion of the electronic housing end cap.

**Step 2**

```{important} Ensure you are knowledgeable on the function of each wire.

Carefully insert each indvidual contacts into the connector housing until you hear an audible click. Ensure that the orientation of the connector housing and cable order matches with the image above. 

If a mistake has been made, a small flat head screw driver can be used to release the contact from the connector housing. Gently use the screw driver and go under the plastic tabs to release each contact. 

```{warning} Ensure that the connection is correct. **The camera will get damaged if the polarity is not correct.**
```

**Step 3**

Connect the assembleed connector housing to a the USB Hub.
